<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Any uncaught exception in <tt>&lt;angular/&gt;</tt> is delegated to this service.
The default implementation simply delegates to $log.error which logs it into
the browser console.</p>

<p>When unit testing it is useful to have uncaught exceptions propagate
to the test so the test will fail rather than silently log the exception
to the browser console. For this purpose you can override this service with
a simple rethrow. </p>
