<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Filters are a standard way to format your data for display to the user. For example, you
might have the number 1234.5678 and would like to display it as US currency: $1,234.57.
Filters allow you to do just that. In addition to transforming the data, filters also modify
the DOM. This allows the filters to for example apply css styles to the filtered output if
certain conditions were met.</p>

<h1>Standard Filters</h1>

<p>The Angular framework provides a standard set of filters for common operations, including:
{@link angular.filter.currency}, {@link angular.filter.json}, {@link angular.filter.number},
and {@link angular.filter.html}. You can also add your own filters.</p>

<h1>Syntax</h1>

<p>Filters can be part of any {@link angular.scope} evaluation but are typically used with
{{bindings}}. Filters typically transform the data to a new data type, formating the data in
the process. Filters can be chained and take optional arguments. Here are few examples:</p>

<ul><li>No filter: {{1234.5678}} =&gt; 1234.5678</li><li>Number filter: {{1234.5678|number}} =&gt; 1,234.57. Notice the “,” and rounding to two
significant digits.</li><li>Filter with arguments: {{1234.5678|number:5}} =&gt; 1,234.56780. Filters can take optional
arguments, separated by colons in a binding. To number, the argument “5” requests 5 digits
to the right of the decimal point.</li></ul>

<h1>Writing your own Filters</h1>

<p>Writing your own filter is very easy: just define a JavaScript function on <code>angular.filter</code>.
The framework passes in the input value as the first argument to your function. Any filter
arguments are passed in as additional function arguments.</p>

<p>You can use these variables in the function:</p>

<ul><li><code>this</code> — The current scope.</li><li><code>$element</code> — The DOM element containing the binding. This allows the filter to manipulate
the DOM in addition to transforming the input.</li></ul>
