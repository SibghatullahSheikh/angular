<blockquote>
  <p>Also I want to pass on my compliments to Misko and Igor for this fantastic project. I'm currently
  rewriting a server-side web application to use this system. I am constantly astounded at how much
  simpler it is to do it this way and I still consider myself a learner.</p>
  
  <p>This is without question the most productive approach to building webapps that I have seen.</p>
  
  <p>The last time I had a coding epiphany was discovering the power and simplicity of JQuery. This is
  way better than that.</p>
  
  <p>I'm interested in promoting this library as widely as possible. I understand that you are still
  developing it and I still have a long way to go before I really understand everything but I think
  you really have something here.</p>

  <p>angular is the best thing I have used in a long time. I am having so much fun, even thought it is
  probably obvious that dynamic web sites are new to me (my experience is more in the back end
  embedded world...)</p>

<h3>Dobrica Pavlinusic</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thanks to great help I received at this list, I was basically able to accomplish my goal to write
  simple conference submission application within a week of first git clone of angular source from
  github.</p>
  
  <p>I think it might be useful to summarize my experience here, especially for people who are still
  wondering if angular is worth a try. Executive summary is: <strong>yes it is!</strong></p>
