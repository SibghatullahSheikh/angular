<h1>Tutorial</h1>
<div class="tutorial"><p>A great way to get introduced to angular is to work through this tutorial, which walks you through
the construction of an angular web app. The app you will build is a catalog that displays a list of
Android devices, lets you filter the list to see only devices that interest you, and then view
details for any device.</p>

<p><img src="img/tutorial/catalog_screen.png"></p>

<p>As you work through this tutorial, you will learn how angular makes browsers smarter — without the
use of extensions or plugins.</p>

<ul>
<li>You will see examples of how to use client-side data binding and dependency injection to build
dynamic views of data that change immediately in response to user actions.</li>
<li>You will see how angular creates listeners on your data without the need for DOM manipulation.</li>
<li>You will learn a better, easier way to test your web apps.</li>
<li>You will learn how to use angular services to make common web tasks, such as getting data into
your app, easier.</li>
</ul>

<p>And all of this works in any browser without modifications!</p>

<p>When you finish the tutorial you will be able to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create a dynamic application that works in any browser</li>
<li>Define the differences between angular and common JavaScript frameworks</li>
<li>Understand how data binding works in angular</li>
<li>Use the angular-seed project to quickly boot-strap your own projects</li>
<li>Create and run tests</li>
<li>Identify resources for learning more about angular</li>
</ul>

<p>The tutorial is will guide you through the process of building a simple application, including
writing and running unit and end-to-end tests, and will allow you to experiment with angular and
the application through experiments suggested at the end of each step.</p>

<p>You can go through the whole tutorial in a couple of hours or you may want to spend a pleasant day
really digging into it. If you're looking for a shorter introduction to angular, check out the

<h2>Working with the code</h2>

<p>There are two ways that you can you follow this tutorial and hack on the code, both available on
Mac/Linux or Windows environment. The first work flow uses Git versioning system for source code
management, the second work flow doesn't depend on any source control system and instead uses
scripts to copy snapshots of project files into your workspace (<code>sandbox</code>) directory. Choose the
one you prefer:</p><doc:tutorial-instructions show="true">

    <ol>
      <li><p>Verify that you have <a href="http://java.com/">Java</a> installed by running the
following command in a terminal window:</p>
      <pre><code>java -version</code></pre>
      <p>You will need Java to run unit tests.</p></li>
      <li><p>Get Git from <a href="http://git-scm.com/download">here</a></p>
      <p>You can build it from source or use pre-compiled package.</p></li>
      <li><p>Clone the angular-phonecat repository located at <a

      <pre><code>git clone git://github.com/angular/angular-phonecat.git</code></pre>
      <p>This will create <code>angular-phonecat</code> directory in current directory.</p></li>
      <li><p>Change your current directory to <code>angular-phonecat</code>:</p>
      <pre><code>cd angular-phonecat</code></pre>
      <p>The tutorial instructions assume you are running all commands from this directory.</p></li>
      <li><p>You'll also need an http server running on your system. Mac and Linux machines
typically have Apache preinstalled.</p>
      <p>If you don't already have an http server installed, you can <a

node.js</a> and use it to run <code>scripts/web-server.js</code> — a simple bundled http
server.</p></li>

      <pre><code>git clone git://github.com/angular/angular-phonecat.git</code></pre>

      <li><p>Change your current directory to angular-phonecat:</p>
      <pre><code>cd angular-phonecat</code></pre>
      <p>The tutorial instructions assume you are running all commands from this directory.</p>
      <p>You should run all <code>git</code> commands from msysGit bash.</p>
      <p>Other commands like <code>test-server.bat</code> or <code>test.bat</code> that will be
introduced soon, should be executed from the windows command line.</li>
      <li><p>You'll also need an http server running on your system.</p>
      <p>If you don't already have an http server installed, you can install <a
href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a>. Just download <a
href="http://node-js.prcn.co.cc/">pre-compiled binaries</a>, unzip them and add
<code>nodejs\bin</code> into your <code>PATH</code> and use <code>node</code> to run
<code>scripts\web-server.js</code> — a simple bundled http server.</p></li>
