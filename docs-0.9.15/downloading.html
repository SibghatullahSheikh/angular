<h2>Including angular scripts from code.angularjs.org</h2>

<p>To get started quickly you without worrying about downloading anything and maintaining a local copy,
you can point your html <code>script</code> tag directly to <a href="http://code.angularjs.org/">http://code.angularjs.org/</a> urls.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of urls you care about:</p>

<ul>
<li>http://code.angularjs.org/angular-<version>.js</li>
<li>http://code.angularjs.org/angular-<version>.min.js</li>
</ul>

<p>The first one is non-minified version, suitable for web development. The latter one is minified
version, which we strongly suggest you use in production.</p>

<p>To point your code to let's say angular version 0.9.12, use the following template:</p><div ng:non-bindable><pre class="brush: js; html-script: true;">
  &lt;!doctype html&gt;
  &lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;My Angular App&lt;/title&gt;
      &lt;script src="http://code.angularjs.org/angular-0.9.12.js" ng:autobind&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
  &lt;/html&gt;
</pre></div><h2>Downloading and hosting the files on your own</h2>

<p>This options is for those who want to work with angular offline, or want to host the angular files
on their own servers.</p>

<p>If you navigate to <a href="http://code.angularjs.org/">http://code.angularjs.org/</a>, you'll see a directory listing with all angular
versions since we started releasing versioned build artifacts (quite late in the project lifetime).</p>

<p>Each directory contains all artifacts that we released for a particular version. Once you navigate
to one of these directories you'll see the following list of files:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>angular-&lt;version&gt;.js</code> - This file is non-obfuscated, non-minified, and human-readable by opening
it it any editor or browser. In order to get better error messages during development, you should
always use this non-minified angular script.</p></li>
<li><p><code>angular-&lt;version&gt;.min.js</code> - This is a minified and obfuscated version of
<code>angular-&lt;version&gt;.js</code> created with Closure compiler. Use this version for production in order to
minimize the size of the application that is downloaded by your user's browser.</p></li>
<li><p><code>angular-&lt;version&gt;.tgz</code> - This is a tarball archive which contains all the other files released
for this angular version. Use this file to get everything in a single download.</p></li>
<li><p><code>angular-ie-compat-&lt;version&gt;.js</code> - This is a special file that contains code and data specifically
tailored for getting Internet Explorer to work with angular. If you host your own copy of angular
files, make sure that this file is available for download and resides under the same parent path as
<code>angular-&lt;version&gt;.js</code> or <code>angular-&lt;version&gt;.min.js</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>angular-mocks-&lt;version&gt;.js</code> - This file contains implementation of mocks that we provide to you
to make testing angular apps even easier. Your unit/integration test harness should load this file
after <code>angular-&lt;version&gt;.js</code> is loaded.</p></li>
<li><p><code>angular-scenario-&lt;version&gt;.js</code> - This file is a very nifty JavaScript file, which allows you to
write and execute end to end tests for angular applications.</p></li>
<li><p><code>docs-&lt;version&gt;</code> - this directory contains all the files that compose the
<a href="http://docs.angularjs.org/">http://docs.angularjs.org/</a> documentation app. These files are handy to see the older version of
our docs, or even more importantly, view the docs offline!</p></li>
</ul></div>
