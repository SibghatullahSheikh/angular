<div class="description"><p>Angular directives create custom attributes for DOM elements. A directive can modify the
behavior of the element in which it is specified. Do not use directives to add elements to the
DOM; instead, use <a href="api/angular.widget"><code>widgets</code></a> to add DOM elements.</p>

<p>For more information about how Angular directives work, and to learn how to create your own
directives, see <a href="guide/dev_guide.compiler.directives">Understanding Angular Directives</a> in
the Angular Developer Guide.</p></div>

<div class="usage"><div ng:non-bindable=""><pre class="brush: js; html-script: true;">directive(name, compileFn);</pre>
</div>
<h3 id="Parameters">Parameters</h3>
<ul class="parameters"><li><code ng:non-bindable="">name – {string} – </code>
<p>Directive identifier (case insensitive).</p></li>
<li><code ng:non-bindable="">compileFn – {function(string, Element)} – </code>
<p>Also called "template function" is a function called
during compilation of the template when the compiler comes across the directive being
registered. The string value of the element attribute representing the directive and
jQuery/jqLite wrapped DOM element are passed as arguments to this function.</p>

<p>The <code>compileFn</code> function may return a linking function also called an instance function.
This function is called during the linking phase when a Scope is being associated with the
template or template clone (see repeater notes below). The signature of the linking function
is: <code>function(Element)</code> where Element is jQuery/jqLite wrapped DOM Element that is being
linked.</p>

<p>The biggest differenciator between the compile and linking functions is how they are being called
when a directive is present within an <a href="api/angular.widget.@ng:repeat"><code>ng:repeat</code></a>. In this case,
the compile function gets called once per occurence of the directive in the template. On the
other hand the linking function gets called once for each repeated clone of the template (times
number of occurences of the directive in the repeated template).</p></li>
