<h2>Downloading</h2>

<p>Follow these steps to download, compile, and host angular.js on your own server:</p>

<h3>Step 0</h3>

<p>If you don't already have Rake (Ruby Make) installed, download and install it from
http://rake.rubyforge.org/.</p>

<h3>Step 1</h3>

<p>Download the angular source code from GitHub: http://github.com/angular/angular.js.</p>

<h3>Step 2</h3>

<p>The source code should include a Rakefile. Compile the source by typing rake compile.</p>

<h3>Step 3</h3>

<p>Host the files on your server. Look through your source tree and make sure that the css and js
directories are parallel (i.e. share a common root node).</p>

<p>In the js directory you should see these different versions of the angular bootstrap code:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>angular-?.?.?.js</strong> - this file is unobfuscated, uncompressed, and human-readable. Note that
despite the name of the file, there is no additional functionality built in to help you debug
your application; it has the prefix debug because you can read the source code.</li>
<li><strong>angular-?.?.?.min.js</strong> - this is a compressed and obfuscated version of <code>angular-?.?.?.js</code>.
You might want to use this version if you want to load a smaller but functionally equivalent
version of the code in your application. Note: this minified version was created using the
Closure Compiler.</li>
</ul></div>
