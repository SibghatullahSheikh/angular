<h2>What is angular?</h2>

<p>Angular teaches your old browser new tricks. It is what HTML would have been if it had been
designed for building web applications.</p>

<p>Take a simple example of user input as shown below. If you were using just HTML and JavaScript to
implement this form, you would need to define listeners, DOM updates, and complex input validators
in order to update and format the result. In angular you can achieve the effect with zero lines
of JavaScript code using a declarative approach. Click on the source tab of the example below to
view the angular implementation of this form.</p><doc:example>
 <doc:source>
  QTY: &lt;input name="qty" value="1" ng:validate="integer:0" ng:required/&gt;
  *
  Cost: &lt;input name="cost" value="19.95" ng:validate="number" ng:required/&gt;
  =
  {{qty * cost | currency}}
 </doc:source>
 <doc:scenario>
  it('should show of angular binding', function(){
    expect(binding('qty * cost')).toEqual('$19.95');
    input('qty').enter('2');
    input('cost').enter('5.00');
    expect(binding('qty * cost')).toEqual('$10.00');
  });
 </doc:scenario>
</doc:example><p>Angular is to AJAX apps as Ruby on Rails is to round trip apps.</p>

<h2>Angular frees you from:</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Registering callbacks:</strong> Registering callbacks clutters your code, and it makes it hard to see
the forest from the trees. Removing common boilerplate code such as callbacks is advantageous
because it leaves the JavaScript with a more succinct version of your code, better describing
what your application does.</li>
<li><strong>Manipulating HTML DOM programatically:</strong> Manipulating HTML DOM is a cornerstone of AJAX
applications, but it is very cumbersome and error-prone. By declaratively describing how the UI
should change as your application state changes, you are freed from low level DOM manipulation
activities. Most applications written with angular never have to programatically manipulate
the DOM.</li>
<li><strong>Marshaling data to and from the UI:</strong> CRUD operations make up the majority of most AJAX
applications. The flow of marshaling data from the server to an internal object to a HTML form,
validating the form, displaying validation errors, returning to an internal model and then back
to the server creates a lot of boilerplate code. angular eliminates almost all of this
boilerplate. leaving code that is richer and describes the overall flow of the application
rather than implementation details.</li>
<li><strong>Writing tons of initialization code just to get started:</strong> Typically you need to write a lot
of plumbing and initialization code just to get a basic "Hello World" AJAX app working. With
angular you can bootstrap your app easily using services, which are auto-injected into your
application in a GUICE-like dependency-injection style. This allows you to get started
developing features quickly. As a bonus, you get full control over the initialization process
in automated tests.</li>
</ul>

<h2>angular is/has:</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>An HTML Compiler:</strong> angular is an HTML compiler in the browser. It allows you to give meaning
to any HTML element, attribute, or text and create new primitives as building blocks for your
application.</li>
<li><strong>Declarative:</strong> Declarative means that you describe what the page looks like rather than
instructing how to draw the page. HTML is great at declaring static documents. Angular extends
the declarative nature of HTML beyond static documents to define dynamic applications.</li>
<li><strong>Declarative Templates:</strong> In angular, you write HTML to declare the view and UI templates for
your application. You can express many common application constructs without using any
JavaScript at all.</li>
<li><strong>Bidirectional Data Binding:</strong> Allows your application to have a single source of truth
(your model), where the HTML is a projection of the internal state of your application, which
you can provide to the user in a declarative way.</li>
<li><strong>Built-in Services:</strong> angular provides many standard AJAX operations to get you going quickly,
and dependency-injection allows you to swap them out as needed. Common services include:
Dependency Inject, History Management, URL Router, AJAX/XHR requests, and data caching,
to name a few.</li>
<li><strong>Very testable:</strong> Testing difficulty is dramatically affected by the way you structure your
code. With angular, testability is baked in.</li>
</ul>

<h2>angular is NOT a:</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Library:</strong> You don't call its functions.</li>
<li><strong>Framework:</strong> It does not call your functions.</li>
<li><strong>DOM Manipulation Library:</strong> It does not provide a way to manipulate DOM, but does provide
primitives to create UI projections of your data.</li>
<li><strong>Widget Library:</strong> There are lots of existing widget libraries that you can integrate with
angular.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Not just another templating system</h2>

<p>At the highest level, angular looks like a just another templating system, but there are few
important reasons why angular is different and makes it a very good fit for application
development.</p>

<p>Angular:
 * <strong>Uses HTML/CSS syntax:</strong> This makes it easy to read and can be edited with existing HTML/CSS
   authoring tools.
 * <strong>Extends HTML vocabulary:</strong> Angular allows you to create new HTML tags, which expand into
   dynamic UI components.
 * <strong>Executes in the browser:</strong> Removes the round trip to the server for many operations and
   creates instant feedback for users.
 * <strong>Bidirectional data binding:</strong> The model is the single source of truth. Programmatic changes
   to the model are automatically reflected in the view. Any changes by the user to the view are
   automatically reflected in the model.
 * <strong>Services:</strong> These allow for a reusable way of injecting dependencies into an application.
 * <strong>MVC:</strong> Clean separation between model-view-controller, which aids in understanding,
   maintenance, and testing of large systems.</p>

<h2>The angular philosophy</h2>

<p>Angular is built around the belief that declarative code is preferred over imperative when it
comes to building UIs and connecting the pieces together.</p>

<p>As an example, if you wanted to add a new label to your application, you could do so by simply
adding text to the HTML template, saving the code, and refreshing your browser:</p><div ng:non-bindable><pre class="brush: js; html-script: true;">
&lt;span class="label"&gt;Hello&lt;/span&gt;
</pre></div><p>In programmatic systems you would have to write and run code like this:</p><div ng:non-bindable><pre class="brush: js; html-script: true;">
var label = new Label();
label.setText('Hello');
label.setClass('label');
parent.addChild(label);
</pre></div><h3>Benefits:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Compile-free: Change your template and logic code and reload the browser to see it run
immediately. In contrast, programmatic serverside views often need to be compiled and executed
to be viewed, which takes time. This dramatically increases the speed of your development cycle.</li>
<li>Declarative templates are easier to understand and change than programmatic instructions.</li>
<li>Declarative templates can be edited in existing HTML editors such as DreamWeaver, Eclipse,
TextMate, Vim, etc.</li>
<li>Declarative templates can be edited by web designers without the need to work with web
developers.</li>
</ul>

<p>HTML is missing certain features, which angular adds via its compiler, thereby "teaching" the
browser these new tricks:</p>

<ul>
<li>Dynamic behavior</li>
<li>Componentizing HTML snippets into reusable components</li>
<li>Dynamically include other HTML templates</li>
<li>Two-way data binding</li>
<li>Rich validation in forms</li>
<li>Model-View-Controller modularization</li>
</ul>
