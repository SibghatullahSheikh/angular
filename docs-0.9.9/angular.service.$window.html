<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Is reference to the browser's <b>window</b> object. While <b>window</b>
is globally available in JavaScript, it causes testability problems, because
it is a global variable. In <b><tt>&lt;angular/&gt;</tt></b> we always refer to it through the
$window service, so it may be overriden, removed or mocked for testing.</p>

<p>All expressions are evaluated with respect to current scope so they don't
suffer from window globality.</p><h2>Example</h2>
<doc:example><doc:source>&lt;input ng:init="greeting='Hello World!'" type="text" name="greeting" /&gt;
&lt;button ng:click="$window.alert(greeting)"&gt;ALERT&lt;/button&gt;</doc:source>
</doc:example>
